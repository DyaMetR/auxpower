## Utilizing the API
The public API is small, and I will only list the generally useful functions, but in case you want to take advantage of it:

### Clientside

`AUXPOW:GetPower()`
> Returns the amount of power the client acknowledges the player has

> **@return** {*number*} power

`AUXPOW:GetFlashlight()`
> Returns the amount of EP2 flashlight battery the client acknowledges the player has

> **@return** {*number*} flashlight battery

#### In case you want to override the HUD elements
`"AuxPowerHUDPaint"` is the event that makes the default Aux. Power HUD be painted. Return **false** if you want to hide it (and draw something in it's place).
> **@param** {*number*} auxiliary power left
> **@param** {*table*} list of expenses

`"EP2FlashlightHUDPaint"` is the event that makes the EP2 flashlight HUD be painted. Return **false** if you want to hide it (and draw something in it's place).
> **@param** {*number*} flashlight battery left
